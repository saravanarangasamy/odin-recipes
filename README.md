# Odin Recipes  

Welcome to Odin Recipes, part of The Odin Project! In this collection, I introduce some of my native dishes to the world. Embracing the idea that "local is global," I proudly showcase traditional Tamil Nadu dishes for everyone to explore.  

1. Idli: A steamed rice and lentil flour cake, soft and nutritious.  
2. Dosa: Made from the same batter as Idli but cooked as a thin, crispy pancake.  
3. Pongal: A comforting dish of rice cooked with ghee, cashews, and spices.  
4. Biryani: A flavorful, hearty meal of rice cooked with meat and a blend of aromatic spices.  

These dishes represent the rich culinary heritage of Tamil Nadu and invite the world to savor their unique flavors!S
